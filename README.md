Falls among the elderly remain a major health concern, often leading to severe injuries,
reduced mobility, and a decline in quality of life. Current solutions, including wearable
devices and passive monitoring systems, fail to prevent falls effectively due to user noncompliance and delayed response times. This research proposes a novel Smart Adaptive
Flooring (SAF) system embedded with AI-integrated piezoelectric sensors to actively predict
and prevent falls. The system detects early instability patterns and dynamically adjusts
surface properties to stabilize the individual, thus mitigating falls in real-time.
